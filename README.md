## Introduction / Summary
###
Athlete monitoring at Batangas State University is still done manually, which makes it hard to track performance and ensure athletes follow requirements. Without a central system, communication between coaches and school staff is slow, causing delays and messy records. This study suggests creating a web-based and mobile application system to make data tracking easier, faster, and more useful for improving athlete performance and managing sports programs better.

### Scope
The platform allows:
- Athlete registration 
- Training/game scheduling
- Practice and Game Tracking
- Practice Compliance Monitoring
- OCR for Documents Management
- Athlete Injury Status Tracking(Mobile App)
- Attendance Location Tracking
- Academic compliance monitoring
- Role-based access for athletes, coaches, admins
