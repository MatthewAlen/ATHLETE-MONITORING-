## Introduction / Summary
###
Athlete monitoring is important in sports to keep athletes performing well, avoid injuries, and meet training and academic requirements, but many schools still use manual methods like paper and spreadsheets, causing delays and poor communication. At Batangas State University, tracking athlete performance, health, and compliance is still manual, leading to late training changes, inconsistent records, and weak coordination between coaches and staff. To solve these problems, this study proposes the BatStateU Athlete Monitoring Systemâ€”a centralized, automated, and web-based platform that uses real-time data, digital records, and performance analytics to improve athlete tracking, training, and overall sports management.

### Scope
The platform allows:
- Athlete registration 
- Training/game scheduling
- Practice and Game Tracking
- Practice Compliance Monitoring
- OCR for Documents Management
- Athlete Injury Status Tracking(Mobile App)
- Attendance Location Tracking
- Academic compliance monitoring
- Role-based access for athletes, coaches, admins

### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **AMS**: Athlete Monitoring System
- **CHED**: Commission on Higher Education
- **OSDP**: Office of Sports Development Program
- **OCR**: Optical Character Recognition
- **PU**: Perceived Usefulness
- **PEU**: Perceived Ease of Use

## Overall Description


## System Architecture
![Blank diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/496e1a1c-31ae-4986-89fc-b2fcb7a98020)
The BatStateU Athlete Monitoring System allows admins, athletes, and coaches to access and manage athlete data through desktop and mobile devices connected to a central web server and database. Admins handle academic compliance and records, athletes check schedules and performance while uploading documents via OCR, and coaches manage training and monitor progress in real time. This setup ensures smooth data flow, better decision-making, and more efficient sports program management.

### Software Perspective & Functions
The BatStateU ARASOF Athlete Monitoring System is a web-based and mobile-accessible platform developed to streamline the management of athlete data within the universityâ€™s sports programs. It follows a modular, role-based structure, where different user types (athletes, coaches, and administrators) access the system with specific permissions based on their roles.

The system is developed using the following technology stack:
- React.js and Bootstrap for a clean and mobile-friendly user interface.
- PHP (Laravel) for handling system processes and user logins.
- MySQL for storing athlete records, training logs, and medical data.
- XAMPP for running the system during development.
